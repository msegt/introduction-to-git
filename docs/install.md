## Installing Git {.tabset}

If you are using a University laptop, you can go directly to [setup.md]. If you are going to use your own computer, here you can find instructions on installing Git for various operating systems:

### Windows
Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash install (see the Shell installation instructions).

### Mac

### Linux
If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run ```bash
sudo apt-get install git``` and for Fedora run ```bash sudo dnf install git```.
