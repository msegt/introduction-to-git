# Exploring History

As we saw in the previous lesson, we can refer to commits by their identifiers. You can refer to the _most recent commit_ of the working directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

We've been adding one line at a time to `mars.txt`, so we can track our progress by looking, so let's do that using our `HEAD`s. Before we start, let's make a change to `mars.txt`.

```bash
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```

```output
Cold and dry, but everything is my favourite colour
It is quite far away from home
And there is very little phone signal
An ill-considered change
```

Now, let's see what we get.

```bash
$ git diff HEAD mars.txt
```

```output
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index b36abfd..0848c8d 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favourite colour

+An ill-considered change
```

which is the same as what you would get if you leave out `HEAD` (try it). The real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits. We do that by adding `~1` (where “~” is “tilde", pronounced [**til**-d*uh*]) to refer to the commit one before `HEAD`.

```bash
$ git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt
```

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff` again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to them:

```bash
$ git diff HEAD~2 mars.txt
```

```output
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..b36abfd 100644

+++ b/mars.txt

We could also use `git show` which shows us what changes we made at an older commit as well as the commit message, rather than the _differences_ between a commit and our working directory that we see by using `git diff`.

```bash
$ git show HEAD~2 mars.txt
```

```output
commit 34961b159c27df3b475cfe4415d94a6d1fcd064d

```

In this way, we can build up a chain of commits. The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`; we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation, so `HEAD~1` means “the previous commit", while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using those long strings of digits and letters that `git log` displays. These are unique IDs for the changes, and “unique” really does mean unique: every change to any set of files on any computer has a unique 40-character identifier. Our first commit was given the ID `f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b`, so let's try this:

```bash
$ git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b mars.txt
```

```output
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt

That's the right answer, but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying, so Git lets us use only the first few characters:

```bash
$ git diff f22b25e mars.txt
```

```output
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..93a3e13 100644

All right! So we can save changes to files and see what we've changed—now how can we restore older versions of things? Let's suppose we accidentally overwrite our file:

```bash
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```

```output
Mars is not really like Earth
```

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed, but those changes haven't been staged:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use “git add <file>...” to update what will be committed)
  (use “git checkout -- <file>...” to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use “git add” and/or “git commit -a")
```

We can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

```bash
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```

```output
Cold and dry, but everything is my favourite colour
It is quite far away from home
And there is very little phone signal
```

As you might guess from its name, `git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file. In this case, we're telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`,
which is the last saved commit. If we want to go back even further,
we can use a commit identifier instead:

```bash
$ git checkout f22b25e mars.txt
```

```bash
$ cat mars.txt
```

```output
Cold and dry, but everything is my favourite colour
```

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
# On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use “git reset HEAD <file>...” to unstage)
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use “git add <file>...” to update what will be committed)
#   (use “git checkout -- <file>...” to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   mars.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use “git add” and/or “git commit -a")
```

Notice that the changes are on the staged area.
Again, we can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

```
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
```

It's important to remember that we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository _before_ the change we're trying to undo. A common mistake is to use the number of the commit in which we made the change we're trying to get rid of.

> As it says, `git checkout` without a version identifier restores files to the state saved in `HEAD`. The double dash `--` is needed to separate the names of the files being recovered from the command itself: without it, Git would try to use the name of the file as the commit identifier.

The fact that files can be reverted one by one tends to change the way people organize their work. If everything is in one large document, it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion. If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files, on the other hand, moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.

> `git checkout` can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have been made, but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed? Make a change to `mars.txt`, add that change, and use `git checkout` to see if you can remove your change.
