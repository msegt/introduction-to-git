# Introduction To Git

A short introduction to Git and the Gitlab server in the School of Computer Science and Informatics.

This course will walk you through the basics of using version control to keep track of your work. There are some very good reasons to use version control:

-   Nothing that is committed to version control is ever lost, unless you work really, really hard at it. Since all old versions of files are saved, it’s always possible to go back in time to see exactly who wrote what on a particular day, or what version of a program was used to generate a particular set of results.

-   As we have this record of who made what changes when, we know who to ask if we have questions later on, and, if needed, revert to a previous version, much like the “undo” feature in an editor.

-   When several people collaborate in the same project, it’s possible to accidentally overlook or overwrite someone’s changes. The version control system automatically notifies users whenever there’s a conflict between one person’s work and another’s.

Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone students can benefit immensely. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all students if you ever need to come back to a project later on (e.g., a year later, when memory has faded), or recover your work to a previous (working) version after changing it a little bit too much (breaking it).

Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.

## Course Information

This course assumes you are using a bash-like command line.

If you are using a University provided laptop you can use Git Bash as the command line. You can find this by hitting the Windows key to bring up the Start Menu, and then by searching for 'Git Bash'. This gives us a windows command line that acts more like bash. If you are using your own machine, you can use the existing command line, or [install Git Bash by downloading it](https://gitforwindows.org/).

Instructions you should enter into the command line look like the following:

```bash
$ type-this-command-and-hit-enter
```
